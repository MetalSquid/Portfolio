            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

            <h3>HEADSHOT</h3>

            <p> I have always had a love for technology and the internet, and my curiostity led
                me to learning how websites work. I fell in love with the process and with the
                satisfaction of creating something like a dynamic webpage from essentially nothing
                and the ability to do so with relatively few tools. A lot of the HTML for these
                portfolio projects I wrote in Notepad while staying late after work. </p>

            <p> On this website you will see work examples, links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts
                and a little bit about me. Before my interest in development I used to work as a chef,
                and then a registered dietitian, where I would travel and work in various acute care hospitals
                during the covid 19 pandemic. I found that while working in healthcare is rewarding, my
                true passion lies in tech and creating. </p>
